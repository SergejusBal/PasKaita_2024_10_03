I ordered a chicken and an egg online,
Just to see who would cross the line.
Got a message that made me pause:
"Order delayed, due to cause."

My plants are thriving, can’t you see?
They’re plastic… but still proud of me.
Thought I’d save cash by skipping the gym,
But now my fridge door gets a workout from me.
